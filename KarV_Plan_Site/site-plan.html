			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to help me with the advertisement of a startup business that I have wanted to do for a while. I am going to be investing in a laser engraver and create a small business on Etsy and other
				media platforms to get the word out and obtain customers. I will be advertising wood engravings, metal engravings, custom and pre-made. This website will contain different types of work that I will be offering and prices.

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Customers, Sports Teams, Couples, Families, Office Management</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I will be making this very phone accessible so that customers can order straight from a phone and the site is clean on any device.
				The Menu will be collapsable on the phone and the menu button will dissapear on normal site view.
				I will be making a "Checkout Form for each Item that is listed so you can see how much it would cost etc to customize it
				and if you want a different quantity as well."

				KarV began as a dream shared by two friends, both 25 years old and based in Nampa, Idaho. While studying web development together, they often talked about starting a small business on the side. This dream quickly grew into a passion project as they discovered the joy of laser engraving. What started as a hobby turned into something they both fell in love with, combining their technical skills and creative visions. Today, KarV is the result of their dedication, creativity, and the strong bond between two friends. Every piece they create is a testament to their commitment to quality and artistry. At KarV, we pour our hearts into every project, bringing unique, personalized engravings to life.
