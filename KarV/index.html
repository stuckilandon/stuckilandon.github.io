While studying web development together, they often talked about starting a small business on the side. This dream quickly grew into a passion project as they discovered the joy of laser engraving. What started as a hobby turned into something they both fell in love with, combining their technical skills and creative visions. Today, KarV is the result of their dedication, creativity, and the strong bond between two friends. Every piece they create is a testament to their commitment to quality and artistry.

I was incredibly impressed with the workmanship and quality of this work! Everything was smooth, no rough edges, they got all of the custom names right, and my wife is absolutely in love with it. 10/10 Guys, good job! - David H</p>
            <p id="test2">I recently purchased a custom engraved wooden plaque from KarV, and I couldn't be happier with the result. The craftsmanship is outstanding, and the attention to detail is incredible. It made the perfect gift for my friend's wedding. Highly recommend! - Sarah M.</p>
            <p id="test3">"I ordered a custom laser-engraved metal sign from KarV for my home office, and it exceeded all my expectations. The detail and precision of the engraving are fantastic, and it adds a really professional touch to my workspace. The customer service was excellent, 
                and they made sure I was happy with every step of the process. I will definitely be returning for more custom items in the future!" - Emily R.</p>
