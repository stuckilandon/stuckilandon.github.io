			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to help me with the advertisement of a startup business that I have wanted to do for a while. I am going to be investing in a laser engraver and create a small business on Etsy and other
				media platforms to get the word out and obtain customers. I will be advertising wood engravings, metal engravings, custom and pre-made. This website will contain different types of work that I will be offering and prices.

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Customers, Sports Teams, Couples, Families, Office Management</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I will be making this very phone accessible so that customers can order straight from a phone and the site is clean on any device.
				Contact link will bring up a popup form to contact.
				clicking on any picture will bring up a pop up form of Qty, custom name, and total price.
